# landing-page

Project where I practice the html, css and flexbox techniques I've learned from the odin project
to replicate what a legitimate website would look like. This is also a project that allows me to practice
commit messages and pushing files to git. I will be revisisiiting this code, to fix the things I want to,
but haven't developed the skill for yet. Eventually I will replace the filler text and images
with content that reflects what a photgrapher's website would look like. This is a playground.
